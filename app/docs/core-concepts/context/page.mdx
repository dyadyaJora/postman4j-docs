# What is context in Postman4j?

Context is a name of postman collection and settings of writing to this collection by postman4j interceptors.
This allow multiple different postman4j interceptors to write to the same context.
For example, you can have multiple apache `HttpClient` in your applicated that intercepted by `Postman4j` - all of them will write to the same context, so all requests will be in the same postman collection.
**By default context name is `Generated Context` and all interceptors write to this context.**

Context name could be defined over `@UsePostmanCollection` annotation or over property `contexts` in folder and request level annotations.

    participant UserCode as Your Method (with @UsePostmanFolderPath)
    participant Aspect as PostmanCoreAspect
    participant Context as IPostmanContext
    participant Interceptor as BasePostmanInterceptor Logic

    UserCode->>Aspect: Method Execution Starts
    Aspect->>Context: setFolderPath("User Management")
    Note right of Context: Context now holds "User Management" for folder path
    Aspect->>UserCode: Proceed with method body
    UserCode->>UserCode: Makes HTTP Call (e.g., to /api/users)
    Note over UserCode,Interceptor: HTTP call triggers Interceptor
    Interceptor->>Context: getFolderPath()
    Context-->>Interceptor: "User Management"
    Interceptor->>Context: getSettings()
    Context-->>Interceptor: settings
    Interceptor->>Context: getData()
    Context-->>Interceptor: collectionDataMap
    Interceptor->>Interceptor: Builds Postman Item and places it in "User Management" folder within collectionDataMap
    UserCode-->>Aspect: Method Execution Finishes
    Aspect->>Context: removeFolderPath()
    Note right of Context: Folder path override is cleared
    Aspect-->>UserCode: Method Returns/Completes
