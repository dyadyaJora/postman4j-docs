# JUnit 5 Integration

RestAssured Interceptor can be used with JUnit 5.
The interceptor is registered as a JUnit rule or extension, which allows you to save the generated Postman collection after each test method execution and use test method name as a folder name in the Postman collection.

```java
import dev.jora.postman4j.junit5.PostmanJunit5Extension;
// ...
@ExtendWith(PostmanJunit5Extension.class)
public class RestAssuredJUnit5ExtensionTest {
    // Your test methods here
}
```
